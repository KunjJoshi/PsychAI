##PSYCH.AI 

###WHY?
Psychology and Psychiatry are still taboo topics in India. People with complex problems may not be willing to come forward to a Doctor with their daily issues, but need a guiding factor to help them. Psych.ai aims at providing an anonymous platform to patients, who want to avoid doctor confrontation and a pre-diagnosis step for doctors before actually facing the patient.**

###WHAT?
Psych.ai is a chatting tool which is finetuned on Psychiatric responses to real-life issues and solutions provided by leading doctors. It is a platform of anonymity and guidance to those who want to solve their problems in a quick timeframe before consulting a doctor. It is also a tool for psychiatrists to pre-diagnose the issues before actually meeting with the Patient.**

###HOW?
A chatting tool is essentially a Large Language Model (LLM), but pre-training one from scratch only on few datapoints is impossible. Hence, the idea of finetuning is used to develop this tool. It is a LLM-with-Adapter, generated using Prompt Triggers and PEFT Method. The base Parent Model used is Mistral-7B v1.0
